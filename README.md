3. **macOS**: Install Docker Desktop for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

After installing Docker, ensure that it is running properly on your system before moving forward.

#### Pinecone Setup
Pinecone is used as the vector store for the examples in this repository. To [set up Pinecone](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/quickstart) and obtain an API key, follow these steps:
1. **Login or Sign up**: If you don't have a Pinecone account, sign up for one by visiting the [Pinecone website](https://app.pinecone.io/?sessionType=signup) and completing the registration process.
2. **Get your API Key**: Open the Pinecone Console, go to API Keys, and copy your API key to a secure location. This key will be required to authenticate your requests when interacting with the Pinecone service.
⚠️ Important: Keep your Pinecone API key confidential and avoid exposing it in public repositories or insecure environments. Treat it as sensitive information to maintain the security of your Pinecone account.

With Docker installed and your Pinecone API key ready, you have everything you need to start exploring the examples and demonstrations provided in the **reppie-labs** repository.
